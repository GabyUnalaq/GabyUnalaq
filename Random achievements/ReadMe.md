# Random Achievements

In this folder, I will list multiple small personal achievements that I am proud of and also, if you are interested, recommend some great ways to get up try new things.

## Sololearn - [link](https://www.sololearn.com/)
This is an app that helped me grow in the direction of coding. It's challenging, educational, fun, and most important: competitive in the art of coding. I really recommend this and if you already are a Sololearn member: `I challenge you!!`
