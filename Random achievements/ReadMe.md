# Random Achievements

In this folder, I will list multiple small personal achievements that I am proud of. If you are interested, here you can find some ideas that might help you as it helped me. :smile:

## Sololearn <img src="https://blob.sololearn.com/avatars/sololearn.png"  width="3%" height="3%">
This is an app that helped me grow in the direction of coding. It's challenging, educational, fun, and most important: competitive in the art of coding. I really recommend this and if you already are a Sololearn member: `I challenge you!!` :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

More info, you can find [here](Sololearn.md).

## Codewars <img src="https://docs.codewars.com/logo.svg"  width="3%" height="3%">
This website is great for challenging yourself to write code efficiently by doing and comparing your work with the others.
